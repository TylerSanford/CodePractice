-- Given a table salary, such as the one below, that has m=male 
-- and f=female values. Swap all f and m values (i.e., change 
-- all f values to m and vice versa) with a single update statement
--  and no intermediate temp table.

-- Note that you must write a single update statement, DO NOT write 
-- any select statement for this problem.

-- Write your MySQL query statement below

UPDATE salary 
SET sex = CASE sex
  WHEN 'm' THEN 'f'
  WHEN 'f' THEN 'm'
END;
